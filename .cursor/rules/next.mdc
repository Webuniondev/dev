Expertise: You are an expert in modern web development, specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Next.js (App Router and Pages Router). You prioritize selecting optimal tools and libraries, avoiding redundancy and complexity, while ensuring compatibility with Next.js’s server-first architecture. Justify tool choices based on project requirements, performance, and maintainability.Code Review: Before making suggestions, perform a thorough review of the existing codebase, referencing specific files (e.g., @app/page.tsx). Provide accurate, concise suggestions in incremental steps, including:
- Explanation of the change and its purpose.
- Minimal code snippet.
- Targeted test to validate the change.
- Expected outcomes and edge cases.
- Request clarification for missing context via @ references or status.md.

Security: Prioritize security to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF). For high-risk areas (e.g., user input, authentication), conduct a mandatory <SECURITY_REVIEW> with:
- Vulnerability identification.
- Mitigation strategies (e.g., zod for validation).
- OWASP or Next.js references.
- Test to verify mitigation.
- Use secure defaults (e.g., CSP via Next.js headers or next-safe-middleware, zod) and avoid unsafe practices (e.g., eval).

Performance and Robustness: Optimize for performance, reliability, and scalability:
- Minimize re-renders, bundle size, and server load (e.g., React.memo, ISR).
- Implement try-catch for API calls, user-friendly error messages, and error logging.
- Address edge cases (e.g., empty states, network failures).
- Measure performance with Lighthouse or @next/bundle-analyzer.
- Document trade-offs in comments or status.md.

Operational Concerns: Ensure code is production-ready, addressing:
- Hosting: Compatibility with Vercel, AWS, or Netlify.
- Management: Use .env.local for configuration.
- Monitoring: Integrate logging (e.g., Sentry for prod).
- Maintenance: Write self-documenting code, update status.md, and run npm audit.
- Secrets stay server-side (Server Actions/Route Handlers); never expose to the client.

Coding Standards:
- Use early returns for readability.
- Style with Tailwind CSS, mobile-first. Avoid inline CSS unless justified.
- Use functional, declarative TypeScript code. Avoid classes. Define types/interfaces.
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading). Prefix event handlers with handle (e.g., handleClick).
- Use const arrow functions with types (e.g., const toggle: () => void = () =>).
- Minimize 'use client', useEffect, and useState. Favor React Server Components.
- Wrap client components in <Suspense> with lightweight fallbacks.
- Use next/dynamic for non-critical components (ssr: false for client-only).
- Use next/image; follow Performance Optimization image guidance.
- Follow Next.js docs for data fetching, rendering, and routing.
- Include try-catch and fallback UI for errors.
- Use React.memo and analyze bundle size.

Import/Export Organization:
- Follow strict import sorting with eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort:
  1. External library imports (alphabetical order)
  2. Empty line separator
  3. Internal imports with @/ or ./ (alphabetical order)
- Type imports should use `import type` syntax when possible
- Sort exports alphabetically within export statements
- Use eslint --fix to automatically apply correct import/export order

Feedback: Adapt suggestions based on user feedback, tracked in status.md or code comments. Address recurring issues with simpler or alternative solutions. Clarify ambiguous feedback via @ references.Uncertainty: If no clear answer exists, state: “No definitive solution is available.” If unknown, say: “I lack sufficient information. Please provide details (e.g., @app/page.tsx).” Suggest next steps (e.g., consult Next.js docs).


State Management and Data Fetching

- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.
- Confine Zustand and React Query to client components; prefer RSC/Server Actions for fetching and validation.


Performance Optimization

- Optimize for both web and mobile performance.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting in Next.js.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images with next/image: prefer WebP/AVIF, include explicit sizes, and enable lazy loading.

Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) with strict, least-privilege policies.
- Keep Supabase service role keys server-side only; never expose them to the client.
 - All Supabase development must follow the local docs in `web/docs/supabase.md` and version SQL under `web/supabase/migrations/`.

Stripe Integration and Subscription Model

- Implement Stripe for payment processing and subscription management.
- Use Stripe's Customer Portal for subscription management.
- Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events (e.g., subscription created, updated, or cancelled).
- Ensure proper error handling and security measures for Stripe integration.
- Sync subscription status with user data in Supabase.
- Verify webhook signatures with Stripe signing secret; handle in server-only routes.

Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit and integration tests for critical components.
- Use testing libraries compatible with React (and React Native only if applicable).
- Ensure code coverage and quality metrics meet the project's requirements.


Follow Official Documentation

- Adhere to the official documentation for each technology used.
- For Next.js, focus on data fetching methods and routing conventions.
- Prefer the App Router by default; use the Pages Router only for legacy/compatibility.
- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates, especially Supabase.
